# Isolate-Examples

Examples of using isolates in Dart, including loading data and performing searches. 

We compare three different approaches: 
* performing tasks in the main thread;
* utilizing ``compute`` for parallel processing;
* using separate isolates.

The experimental results demonstrate the benefits of isolates, including improved performance and frame rate.
